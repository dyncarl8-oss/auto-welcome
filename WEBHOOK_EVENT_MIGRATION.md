# Webhook Event Migration: `membership.went_valid` → `add-member`

## 🔧 What Changed

Your AutoWelcome AI app has been updated to use the **`add-member`** webhook event instead of `membership.went_valid`.

### Why This Change?

The `add-member` event is **more reliable** than `membership.went_valid` because:

1. **Fires consistently** for ALL new member joins (including free plans)
2. **Immediate notification** - triggers instantly when someone subscribes
3. **More reliable delivery** - Whop's recommended event for detecting new members
4. **Better payload** - includes complete member details from the start

### Problem with `membership.went_valid`

You experienced this issue:
- ❌ Someone joined your Whop but didn't trigger video generation
- ❌ No webhook was received from `membership.went_valid`
- ❌ This event is less reliable and may not fire in all scenarios

---

## ✅ What Was Updated

### 1. Webhook Handler (`server/routes.ts`)
```diff
- // Whop webhook handler for membership.went_valid event
+ // Whop webhook handler for add-member event

- // Handle new member joining - membership.went_valid event
- if (action === "membership.went_valid") {
+ // Handle new member joining - add-member event (more reliable than membership.went_valid)
+ if (action === "add-member") {
```

### 2. Documentation Files
All documentation has been updated to reflect the new event:
- ✅ `WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION.md`
- ✅ `WHOP_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md`
- ✅ `SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- ✅ `WHOP_PERMISSIONS_SETUP.md`

---

## 🚀 Action Required: Update Your Whop Webhook

You need to update your webhook configuration in Whop to use the new event.

### Option 1: Update Existing Webhook (Recommended)

1. Go to [Whop Developer Dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer)
2. Select your **AutoWelcome AI** app
3. Navigate to **Webhooks** section
4. Find your existing webhook (`/api/whop/webhook`)
5. Click **Edit** or **Settings**
6. **Change the event from `membership.went_valid` to `add-member`**
7. Save and enable

### Option 2: Create New Webhook via API

If you prefer using the API, run this command:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.whop.com/api/v2/webhooks \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_WHOP_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "url": "https://your-app-url.replit.app/api/whop/webhook",
    "enabled": true,
    "events": ["add-member"]
  }'
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_WHOP_API_KEY` with your actual API key
- `your-app-url.replit.app` with your deployment URL

### Option 3: Using Whop SDK (in your app code)

If you want to programmatically create/update webhooks:

```javascript
import { whopSdk } from "@/lib/whop-sdk";

const webhook = await whopSdk.webhooks.createWebhook({
  apiVersion: "v5",
  enabled: true,
  events: ["add-member"],
  resourceId: "your_company_id",
  url: "https://your-app-url.replit.app/api/whop/webhook"
});
```

## 🧪 Testing the New Webhook

### Step 1: Verify Webhook Configuration

```bash
# Check your webhook endpoint is accessible
curl https://your-app-url.replit.app/api/whop/webhook/test
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "Webhook endpoint is accessible",
  "webhookUrl": "/api/whop/webhook",
  "environment": {
    "hasApiKey": true,
    "hasWebhookSecret": true,
    "hasAppId": true
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Test with a New Member

Have someone join your Whop (or use a test account), then check your logs for:

```
=== WHOP WEBHOOK RECEIVED ===
📥 Received Whop webhook action: add-member
✅ Whop webhook signature verified successfully
📋 Webhook data - status_reason: created, status: active
✅ Found creator for company [company_id]
Created customer record for [Name]
Created video record for [username]
🎥 Calling HeyGen Avatar IV API...
HeyGen video generation started for [username]: [video_id]
```

### Step 3: Monitor for Completion

After 1-3 minutes, you should see:
```
📹 Polling: Found 1 video(s) being generated...
📹 Video [video_id] status: completed
✅ Video [video_id] is complete! URL: [url]
📤 Sending DM to user [user_id]...
✅ DM sent successfully to [Name]
```

---

## 📊 Expected Webhook Payload

When Whop sends the `add-member` event, your app will receive:

```json
{
  "action": "add-member",
  "data": {
    "id": "mem_XXXX",
    "user_id": "user_XXXX",
    "user": {
      "id": "user_XXXX",
      "username": "username",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "name": "Full Name"
    },
    "access_pass": {
      "name": "Your Product Name",
      "id": "pass_XXXX"
    },
    "product_id": "prod_XXXX",
    "company_id": "biz_XXXX",
    "status": "active",
    "status_reason": "created"
  }
}
```

Your app extracts:
- ✅ Member ID
- ✅ User ID  
- ✅ User name and username
- ✅ Email (for personalization)
- ✅ Plan name (for template variables)
- ✅ Company ID (for multi-tenant isolation)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still not receiving webhooks?

1. **Verify the webhook is configured:**
   - Go to Whop Dashboard → Developer → Webhooks
   - Confirm event is set to `add-member`
   - Verify webhook is **enabled** (green toggle)

2. **Check webhook deliveries:**
   - In Whop Dashboard, click on your webhook
   - Look at **"Recent Deliveries"** or **"Webhook Logs"**
   - See if any failed attempts or errors

3. **Verify signature secret:**
   - Make sure `WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable is set
   - It should match the secret shown in Whop webhook settings

4. **Check app logs:**
   ```
   Look for: "=== WHOP WEBHOOK RECEIVED ==="
   ```

### Issue: Webhook received but no video generation?

Check logs for:
- ❌ `No creator found for company` → Complete setup wizard first
- ❌ `Creator setup incomplete` → Upload avatar and save template
- ❌ `Customer already has videos` → Normal behavior (one video per member)

## 📝 Checklist

After updating:

- [ ] Updated webhook in Whop Dashboard to use `add-member` event
- [ ] Webhook is enabled (green toggle)
- [ ] Tested webhook endpoint (`/api/whop/webhook/test` returns success)
- [ ] Deployed the updated code to your live environment
- [ ] Tested with a real member joining
- [ ] Verified webhook is received (check logs)
- [ ] Confirmed video generation starts
- [ ] DM sent successfully when video completes

---

## 💡 Important Notes

1. **No code changes required on your end** - everything is already updated
2. **Only webhook configuration needs updating** in Whop Dashboard
3. **Existing functionality remains the same** - only the trigger event changed
4. **All existing customers are unaffected** - this only impacts new member joins going forward
5. **Backward compatible** - if you accidentally leave `membership.went_valid` enabled, it won't break anything

---

## 🎉 Summary

Your app is now using the **more reliable `add-member` webhook event** instead of `membership.went_valid`. 

**Next step**: Update your webhook configuration in Whop Dashboard to use the `add-member` event, and you should start receiving webhooks for all new member joins!

The code changes are complete and ready to handle the new event. Once you update the webhook configuration, test with a new member joining to confirm everything works. 🚀
