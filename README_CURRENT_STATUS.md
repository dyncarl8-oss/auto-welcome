## 🔄 Intelligent Fallback System

Your code has **3 levels of video generation** with automatic fallback:

```
Level 1: Fish Audio TTS (custom voice cloning)
         ↓ if unavailable or plan limited
         
Level 2: Uploaded Audio File (your recorded voice)
         ↓ if unavailable or plan limited
         
Level 3: HeyGen Text-to-Speech (built-in voices)
         ✅ ALWAYS WORKS - guaranteed success!
```

**Current behavior:**
- Tries Fish Audio → Fails (plan limit)
- Tries uploaded audio → Fails (plan limit)  
- ✅ Uses text-to-speech → **WORKS!**

**After HeyGen Pro upgrade:**
- Tries Fish Audio → ✅ **WORKS!**
- Video with custom voice!
