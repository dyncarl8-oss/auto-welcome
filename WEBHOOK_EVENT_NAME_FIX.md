# Webhook Event Name Fix

## Problem

The webhook endpoint was receiving events from Whop successfully (verified by logs showing the webhook being received with status 200), but **the events were not being processed** to generate welcome videos for new members.

### Root Cause

The issue was a **mismatch in event name format**:

- **Whop sends events with dots (`.`)**: `"membership.went_valid"`
- **Your code was checking for underscores (`_`)**: `"membership_went_valid"`

This meant that when a real member joined, Whop would send the `membership.went_valid` event, but your code would not recognize it and skip processing.

### Evidence from Logs

Your logs showed:
```json
{
  "action": "membership.went_valid",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

But the code was checking:
```typescript
if (action === "membership_went_valid" || action === "app_membership_went_valid")
```

So the event was received, signature verified, and acknowledged with `200 OK`, but **no video generation was triggered** because the event name didn't match.

## Solution

Updated the webhook handler in `server/routes.ts` to check for **both dot and underscore formats**:

```typescript
if (action === "membership.went_valid" || action === "membership.created" || 
    action === "membership_went_valid" || action === "app_membership_went_valid") {
```

### Changes Made

1. **Updated event name checks** (line 1374-1375 in `routes.ts`)
   - Added support for `membership.went_valid` (with dot)
   - Added support for `membership.created` (when a new member is created)
   - Kept backward compatibility with underscore format

2. **Added better logging**
   - Added log when processing new member events
   - Added log when webhook action is not recognized

3. **Updated documentation**
   - Updated `WHOP_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md` with correct event names
   - Added note about dots vs underscores
   - Updated example payloads and log messages

## Expected Behavior Now

When a new member joins:

1. âœ… Whop sends webhook with `action: "membership.went_valid"`
2. âœ… Your app receives it and logs: `ðŸ“¥ Received Whop webhook action: membership.went_valid`
3. âœ… Your app recognizes the event and logs: `âœ… Processing new member webhook event: membership.went_valid`
4. âœ… Customer record is created
5. âœ… Video generation is triggered
6. âœ… Video is sent via DM when complete

## What You Need to Do

**Nothing!** The fix is complete. The next time a real member joins, the webhook will be processed correctly.

However, you can verify the fix is working by:

1. **Check your webhook configuration in Whop dashboard**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Webhooks
   - Make sure events selected are: `membership.went_valid` or `membership.created`

2. **Test with a new member**
   - Have someone join your community
   - Watch the logs - you should now see:
     ```
     ðŸ“¥ Received Whop webhook action: membership.went_valid
     âœ… Processing new member webhook event: membership.went_valid
     New member joined: [name] (@username, user_xxx)
     ```

3. **If you still don't see the processing log**, check that:
   - The webhook event in Whop dashboard is set to `membership.went_valid` (with dots)
   - Your webhook URL is correct: `https://auto-welcome-syaj.onrender.com/api/whop/webhook`
   - The webhook is enabled in Whop dashboard

## Testing the Fix

You can test the webhook manually using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://auto-welcome-syaj.onrender.com/api/whop/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-whop-signature: t=1234567890,v1=dummy_signature_for_testing" \
  -d '{
    "action": "membership.went_valid",
    "data": {
      "id": "mem_test123",
      "user_id": "user_test123",
      "product_id": "pass_test123",
      "plan_id": "plan_test123",
      "page_id": "biz_test123",
      "status": "completed",
      "valid": true
    }
  }'
```

Note: This may fail signature verification if `WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set, but you should still see the log showing the action was received.

## Summary

The webhook was working perfectly - it was receiving events, verifying signatures, and responding with 200 OK. The only issue was that the **event name format check was incorrect**, causing the code to skip the video generation logic. This is now fixed!
