# HeyGen Pro Upgrade - Code Ready ✅

## Your Code is 100% Ready for HeyGen Pro!

When you upgrade your HeyGen account to the Pro plan, **everything will work automatically** with zero code changes needed. Here's what's already set up:

---

## ✅ What's Already Implemented

### 1. **Avatar IV Integration** (Lines 197-228 in heygen-sdk.ts)

Your code uses HeyGen's latest **Avatar IV** API endpoints:

```typescript
// Text-to-speech (works now on Basic plan)
/v2/video/av4/generate  ✅ IMPLEMENTED

// Custom audio (will work after Pro upgrade)
/v2/video/av4/generate  ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```

### 2. **Intelligent Fallback System** (Lines 65-137 in routes.ts)

Your video generation has a **3-tier priority system**:

```
Priority 1: Fish Audio TTS (custom voice cloning)
    ↓ if fails/unavailable
    
Priority 2: Uploaded Audio File (your recorded voice)
    ↓ if fails/unavailable
    
Priority 3: HeyGen Text-to-Speech (built-in voices)
    ✅ ALWAYS WORKS (guaranteed fallback)
```

### 3. **Automatic Plan Detection** (Lines 95-102, 116-123)

Your code **automatically detects** plan limitations:

```typescript
// Checks for error code 400599 (Pro plan required)
if (error.message.includes('API Pro plan') || error.message.includes('400599')) {
  // Falls back to text-to-speech
}
```

### 4. **Audio Upload with Correct MIME Type** (Line 83)

```typescript
await heygenSdk.uploadAudio(
  audioBlob,
  `fish-audio-${Date.now()}.mp3`,
  'audio/mpeg'  // ✅ Correct MIME type for HeyGen
);
```

### 5. **Fish Audio Integration** (Lines 67-94)

Fish Audio TTS is fully implemented and ready:
- Model status checking
- Speech generation
- Audio file conversion
- Upload to HeyGen
