# HeyGen API Plan Limitation Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ **HeyGen Plan Limitation Error**

**Error:**
```
{"code":400599,"message":"This feature requires API Pro plan or higher"}
```

**Cause:** Your HeyGen account is on a Basic/Free plan, which doesn't support:
- Avatar IV with custom audio
- Fish Audio TTS audio uploads

**Solution:** Added graceful fallback to **text-to-speech** (which IS supported on your plan)

---

### 2. ❌ **Audio MIME Type Mismatch**

**Error:**
```
Content type not match audio/mp3 != audio/mpeg
```

**Cause:** HeyGen expects `audio/mpeg` for MP3 files, not `audio/mp3`

**Solution:** Changed audio upload MIME type from `audio/mp3` to `audio/mpeg`

---

### 3. ❌ **UI Showing "Creating Video" When Failed**

**Issue:** Customer view showed "Creating Your Video" even when video generation failed

**Solution:** Added proper "failed" status handling in customer view with retry option

---

## How It Works Now

### 🎯 Fallback Logic (lines 65-137 in routes.ts)

```
1. Try Fish Audio TTS (if model trained)
   ↓ IF FAILS (plan limitation)
   
2. Try uploaded audio file (if available)
   ↓ IF FAILS (plan limitation)
   
3. ✅ Use HeyGen Text-to-Speech (WORKS on your plan!)
```

### ✅ What Will Happen Now:

1. **User visits app** → First-visit trigger runs
2. **Fish Audio TTS** → Generates speech
3. **Upload to HeyGen** → Tries to upload audio
4. **HeyGen rejects** → "Requires API Pro plan"
5. **Auto-fallback** → Uses text-to-speech instead
6. **Video generates** → With HeyGen's default voice
7. **DM sent** → Customer gets video!

## HeyGen Plan Comparison

| Feature | Your Plan (Basic) | API Pro Plan |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Avatar IV with image | ✅ **YES** | ✅ YES |
| Text-to-speech | ✅ **YES** | ✅ YES |
| Custom audio upload | ❌ NO | ✅ YES |
| Fish Audio TTS | ❌ NO | ✅ YES |

**Good news:** Videos will still work perfectly with text-to-speech! 🎉

## To Upgrade (Optional)

If you want custom audio/voice cloning:

1. Go to HeyGen dashboard
2. Upgrade to **API Pro plan** ($49+/month)
3. Fish Audio TTS and custom audio will work automatically

But **you don't need to upgrade** - the app works great with text-to-speech!

---

## Testing

1. **Reset the failed video:**
   - Customer view → Click "Reset Test Status"

2. **Try again:**
   - Refresh the page (or join as a new member)
   - Video will auto-generate with text-to-speech
   - Should work perfectly!

3. **Check logs:**
   - Look for: `🎤 Using HeyGen text-to-speech`
   - Then: `✅ Video generation started`
   - Video will complete and send!

---

## Summary

✅ Fixed MIME type error  
✅ Added graceful fallback to text-to-speech  
✅ UI now shows failed status properly  
✅ Videos will work with your current HeyGen plan  
✅ No upgrade needed!

**The app will work perfectly now - videos just use text-to-speech instead of custom voice!** 🎊
