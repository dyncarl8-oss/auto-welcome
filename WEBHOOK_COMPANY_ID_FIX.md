# Webhook Company ID Fix ✅

## What Was the Problem?

Your webhook test showed:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "No company ID in webhook"
}
```

This means:
- ✅ Webhook endpoint is accessible
- ✅ Webhook is being received
- ❌ Webhook payload doesn't include `company_id` field

---

## What I Fixed

### 1. **Enhanced Logging**
Added full webhook payload logging so we can see exactly what fields Whop sends:
```javascript
console.log("📋 Full webhook data object:", JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
```

### 2. **Multiple Company ID Sources**
Now tries to find company_id from multiple possible locations:
```javascript
// Try webhook payload (multiple field names)
companyId = data.company?.id || data.company_id || data.biz_id || data.business_id;

// If not in webhook, fetch from membership
if (!companyId && memberId) {
  const membership = await whopSdk.memberships.getMembership({ id: memberId });
  companyId = membership.company_id || membership.company?.id;
}

// If still not found, use first setup creator (with warning)
if (!companyId) {
  const allCreators = await storage.getAllCreators();
  const setupCreator = allCreators.find(c => c.isSetupComplete);
  companyId = setupCreator.whopCompanyId;
}
```

### 3. **Fallback for Single-Tenant**
If you only have ONE company using the app, it will automatically use that creator even if company_id is missing from the webhook.

---

## What You Need to Do NOW

### Step 1: Redeploy Your App

Deploy the updated code to Render:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Enhanced company_id extraction from webhooks"
git push
```

Render will auto-deploy.

### Step 2: Test the Webhook Again

Once deployed, go to Whop Dashboard and send another test webhook.

### Step 3: Check Your Logs

Look at your Render logs (or server logs) for these key messages:

#### You Should See:
```
=== WHOP WEBHOOK RECEIVED ===
📥 Received Whop webhook action: membership_went_valid
📋 Full webhook data object: { ... }
```

This will show you **exactly what fields** are in the webhook payload.

#### Then One of These:
```
Option A: Company ID found in webhook
📦 Membership data - Company ID: biz_xxxxx, Product ID: prod_xxxxx
🔍 Looking for creator with company ID: biz_xxxxx
```

```
Option B: Company ID fetched from membership
📋 No company_id in webhook payload, attempting to fetch from membership...
📋 Fetched membership: { ... }
📦 Membership data - Company ID: biz_xxxxx, Product ID: prod_xxxxx
```

```
Option C: Fallback to first creator
⚠️ No company ID found in webhook or membership - falling back to first setup creator
📋 Using fallback creator with company ID: biz_xxxxx
🔍 Looking for creator with company ID: biz_xxxxx
```

### Step 4: Look for Success Messages
```
✅ Found creator for company biz_xxxxx: creator_id
Created customer record for [Name]
Created video record for [username]
HeyGen video generation started for [username]: video_xxxxx
```

---

## Understanding the Logs

### Scenario 1: Company ID in Webhook ✅ (Best)
```
📦 Membership data - Company ID: biz_123, Product ID: prod_456
```
Perfect! Whop is sending the company_id.

### Scenario 2: Company ID from Membership API ⚠️ (OK)
```
📋 No company_id in webhook payload, attempting to fetch from membership...
📋 Fetched membership: {...}
📦 Membership data - Company ID: biz_123
```
Webhook doesn't have it, but we fetched it from the API. Works fine, just an extra API call.

### Scenario 3: Fallback to First Creator ⚠️ (Single-Tenant Only)
```
⚠️ No company ID found in webhook or membership - falling back to first setup creator
```
This works if you only have ONE company using your app. If you plan to be multi-tenant, this could cause issues.

---

## Next Steps Based on What You See

### If You See "Company ID: biz_xxxxx" in Logs ✅

Great! The fix worked. Continue to look for:
```
✅ Found creator for company biz_xxxxx
Created customer record
HeyGen video generation started
```

### If You See "No creator found for company biz_xxxxx" ❌

This means the webhook is working, but your database doesn't have a creator with that company ID.

**Solution:**
1. Log into your app as admin
2. Complete the setup wizard
3. The app will save your company ID to the database
4. Test webhook again

### If You See "No creator setup yet" ❌

**Solution:**
1. Go to your app: https://auto-welcome-syaj.onrender.com
2. Log in as admin
3. Complete setup:
   - Upload avatar photo
   - Train voice or upload audio
   - Save message template
4. Test webhook again

## Testing Checklist

After deploying the fix:

- [ ] Deploy updated code to Render
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete
- [ ] Send test webhook from Whop Dashboard
- [ ] Check Render logs for webhook receipt
- [ ] Verify company ID is found (from webhook, membership, or fallback)
- [ ] Verify creator is found
- [ ] Verify video generation starts
- [ ] Test with real member joining

## What This Fixes

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Company ID missing | ❌ Webhook rejected | ✅ Fetched from membership |
| Unknown field names | ❌ Only checked `company_id` | ✅ Checks multiple fields |
| Single-tenant use | ❌ Required company_id | ✅ Falls back to first creator |
| Debugging | ❌ Limited info | ✅ Full payload logged |

---

## Share Your Logs

After testing, share your logs here so I can see:
1. What fields are in the webhook payload
2. Whether company_id was found
3. Whether creator was matched
4. Whether video generation started

Look for the section starting with:
```
=== WHOP WEBHOOK RECEIVED ===
```

Copy everything from there until you see video generation start (or error).

---

## Important Notes

1. **This will now work even without company_id in webhook** (for single-tenant)
2. **Full webhook payload is logged** for debugging
3. **Multiple fallback methods** ensure it works in different scenarios
4. **If you plan multi-tenant**, make sure Whop sends company_id or we fetch from membership

---

## Summary

✅ **Code updated** - Multiple ways to get company_id  
✅ **Better logging** - See exactly what Whop sends  
✅ **Fallback support** - Works even if company_id missing  
✅ **Ready to deploy** - Push to Render and test  

Deploy this and test again - it should work now! 🚀
